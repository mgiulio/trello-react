# About

An ongoing [Trello](http://trello.com) client *thinked in* [React](https://facebook.github.io/).

I started this project to make some practice with React. At the moment it is partially imitating the Trello web client, but it could evolve(*degenerate?*:)) into something else.

To be more precise, it is not just an exercise in React development, but rather a pretest to test on the battlefield and to mix'n'match several front end development techniques.
And it has already slightly crossed the FE/BE border because from v0.3 the app runs on Openshift with a very basic Express.js server.
